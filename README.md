s-test
======

Hi.

It's a basic sf2 app. Was in two minds whether or not to use sf2, but decided to if only for the DIC.

Dependencies defined in composer.

To run use `php app/console sainsburys:scrape`

I've included some tests that exercise the main moving parts without testing internals.

Run using `php vendor/bin/phpunit test`
